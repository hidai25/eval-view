      "final_output": "Quick answer \u2014 TL;DR:\nTech stocks are mainly driven by macroeconomic conditions (interest rates, growth), company fundamentals (revenue/earnings growth, margins, cash flow), industry-specific supply/innovation cycles (semiconductors, AI), regulation/geopolitics, investor sentiment/liquidity, and short-term technicals.\n\nCore explanation \u2014 main factors (what they are and why they matter)\n- Interest rates & monetary policy  \n  - Why: Tech companies\u2019 valuations are sensitive to discount rates because much of their value is in expected future cash flows. Higher rates typically reduce the present value of long-duration growth cash flows, which can pressure high-multiple tech stocks.  \n  - What to watch: Fed guidance, real rates, 10\u2011year Treasury yield, inflation prints.\n\n- Economic growth & demand environment  \n  - Why: Enterprise IT spending, ad budgets, consumer device demand, and cloud adoption track macro growth. A slowdown tends to compress revenues and margins; a pickup supports cyclical tech revenue.  \n  - What to watch: GDP, PMI, corporate IT spend surveys, capex trends.\n\n- Company fundamentals & execution  \n  - Why: Revenue growth, profitability (gross margin, operating margin), free cash flow, and unit economics drive long-term outcomes. Profitability/cash flow matter more for valuation resilience.  \n  - What to watch: Quarterly earnings, guidance, churn metrics (for SaaS), FCF and capex levels.\n\n- Innovation/product cycles & competitive positioning  \n  - Why: New product cycles (AI, cloud features, chips, devices) can create winners and re-rate whole sub-sectors. Competitive dynamics (pricing, moat) determine sustainable margins.  \n  - What to watch: Product roadmaps, adoption metrics, developer ecosystem growth, patent/tech leadership.\n\n- Supply chain & capital goods cycles (semiconductors, components)  \n  - Why: Chip availability, lead times, and pricing affect hardware makers and data\u2011center equipment vendors. Semiconductor cycles are especially impactful for chipmakers and OEMs.  \n  - What to watch: Inventory levels, fab utilization, chip lead times, supplier commentary.\n\n- Regulation, antitrust & data/security risks  \n  - Why: Privacy rules, antitrust actions, export controls (e.g., US\u2013China tech export restrictions) can limit addressable markets or increase compliance costs. Security breaches can materially hurt revenue and trust.  \n  - What to watch: Legislative developments, DOJ/FTC actions, trade policy news, major security incidents.\n\n- Geopolitics & trade relations  \n  - Why: China policy, sanctions, and cross-border restrictions affect supply chains and TAM (total addressable market) \u2014 especially for semiconductors, cloud providers, and social platforms.  \n  - What to watch: Export rules, tariffs, diplomatic developments.\n\n- Market liquidity, flows & sentiment  \n  - Why: ETF flows, retail vs institutional appetite, and momentum can amplify moves. Growth stocks often experience larger flows into/out of concentrated funds or thematic ETFs.  \n  - What to watch: ETF flows (e.g., technology ETFs), put/call skew, concentration in large-cap names.\n\n- Valuation starting point  \n  - Why: High initial multiples (many tech names trade at growth premiums) mean small disappointments can lead to outsized multiple compression. Conversely, cheaper relative valuation can provide cushion.  \n  - What to watch: P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG, FCF yield \u2014 always benchmarked to the tech sub-sector (growth software vs semiconductor vs consumer internet).\n\n- Short-term technicals & market structure  \n  - Why: Price trends, moving average crossovers, volume spikes, and momentum signals govern entry/exit timing for many traders. Technicals can prolong rallies or accelerate declines.  \n  - What to watch: Trend (50/200-day MAs), RSI, MACD, volume. (Per technical confirmation best practice: confirm signals with volume, support/resistance, and multi\u2011timeframe alignment.)\n\nHow these interact \u2014 simple scenarios (not predictions)\n- If rates fall and growth stabilizes \u2192 long-duration growth tech often re-rates higher (bull/base scenario).  \n- If economic indicators weaken and rates rise \u2192 revenue guidance gets cut and high multiples compress (bear scenario).  \n- If an innovation (e.g., a widely adopted AI platform) accelerates monetization \u2192 revenues and margins can expand, altering relative valuations (positive sector-specific outcome).  \nThese are possible outcomes based on historical patterns, not forecasts.\n\nPractical application \u2014 what investors/researchers typically monitor\n- Macro calendar: Fed meetings, CPI/PCE, jobs reports.  \n- Earnings season: guidance changes and subscription metrics for SaaS.  \n- Supply-chain commentary from suppliers (chipmakers, ODMs).  \n- Regulatory headlines and trade policy updates.  \n- Fund flows into/out of tech ETFs and large-cap concentration moves.  \n- Technical confirmation: volume + MA alignment + multi\u2011timeframe checks before acting on signals.\n\nTapeScope tools that help analyze these factors\n- Macro and economic calendar alerts (Fed, CPI, jobs)  \n- Earnings calendar + company guidance highlights  \n- News feed filtered by ticker/issue (regulation, supply chain, product",
