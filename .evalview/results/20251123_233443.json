The response does not include any mention of P/E ratio or specific metrics related to AAPL, which affects its completeness and accuracy in addressing the query.

However, I can provide a general framework for analyzing stock performance, which you can apply to AAPL or any other stock:\n\n1. **Price Trends**: Look at the historical price data to identify trends. This includes examining daily, weekly, and monthly price movements to understand the stock's volatility and overall direction.\n\n2. **Financial Statements**: Review the company's financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Key metrics to consider are revenue growth, profit margins, and cash flow.\n\n3. **Earnings Reports**: Analyze the latest earnings reports to see how the company is performing relative to analyst expectations. Pay attention to earnings per share (EPS), revenue, and any forward guidance provided by the company.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Consider the overall market sentiment towards the stock. This can be gauged through news articles, analyst ratings, and investor forums.\n\n5. **Technical Analysis**: Use technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to assess the stock's momentum and potential future movements.\n\n6. **Industry and Economic Factors**: Evaluate how industry trends and broader economic conditions might impact the stock. This includes looking at competitor performance, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic indicators.\n\n7. **Dividends and Buybacks**: Check if the company pays dividends or has a share buyback program, as these can be indicators of financial health and shareholder value.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date analysis, I recommend checking financial news websites, stock market analysis platforms, or consulting with a financial advisor.",
