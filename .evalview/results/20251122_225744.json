      "final_output": "Quick answer\nThe main factors are macro (interest rates, growth/inflation), company fundamentals (revenue/growth, margins, cash flow), sector dynamics (AI demand, semiconductors, cloud/SaaS economics), capital markets & investor flows, regulation/geopolitics, and technical/market-structure signals \u2014 each can move tech stocks differently depending on company size, business model and timeframe.\n\nCore explanation \u2014 what to watch and why\n- Interest rates & monetary policy\n  - Why it matters: Higher rates raise discount rates for future earnings, which tends to weigh more on high-growth tech names that have earnings far in the future.\n  - What to watch: Fed guidance, real yields, curve steepness. Data suggests rising rates compress growth-stock multiples; easing can support higher valuations.\n- Growth & revenue momentum (company fundamentals)\n  - Why it matters: Tech valuations rely heavily on expected growth. Revenue growth, guidance, and ARR/retention (for SaaS) drive investor re-ratings.\n  - What to watch: Quarterly revenue, forward guidance, churn, gross margins, and free cash flow. Negative FCF can be normal for early/high-capex firms \u2014 context matters.\n- Profitability & cash flow metrics\n  - Why it matters: Margins and free cash flow affect sustainability and ability to invest or return capital.\n  - Sector context: Software/SaaS typically have higher margins (20\u201335% SaaS), hardware/lifecycle businesses lower.\n- Valuation vs peers\n  - Why it matters: Multiples determine sensitivity to news. Tech/growth P/E ranges: mature/value 8\u201315; market avg 15\u201320; growth 25\u201340; high-growth tech 40\u2013100+.\n  - What to watch: P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S and FCF yield compared to industry peers.\n- Sector-specific demand (AI, cloud, semiconductors)\n  - Why it matters: Structural trends (AI adoption, cloud spend, 5G) create winners and crowd flows. For example, AI accelerates demand for GPUs and cloud compute.\n  - What to watch: Customer spend trends, product cycles, backlog, and end-market adoption metrics.\n- Supply chain & input constraints\n  - Why it matters: Chip shortages, logistics, and component availability directly affect hardware makers and device timelines.\n  - What to watch: Capacity announcements, lead times, supplier comments (e.g., TSMC guidance).\n- Regulation, trade policy & geopolitics\n  - Why it matters: Antitrust, data-privacy rules, export controls (especially chip export rules to China), and cross-border tensions can alter addressable markets and costs.\n  - What to watch: Legislative developments, DOJ/FTC actions, and export-control news.\n- Capital markets & investor flows\n  - Why it matters: ETF/active fund flows, secondary offerings, and IPOs influence liquidity and sentiment in names and sub-sectors.\n  - What to watch: Fund flows into/away from tech ETFs, secondary issuance, insider buying/selling.\n- Sentiment & momentum (technical factors)\n  - Why it matters: Momentum, RSI, moving-average crossovers and volume can drive short-term price moves independent of fundamentals.\n  - Confirmation to use (always check): volume trends, support/resistance, 50/200-day moving averages, MACD, and multi-timeframe checks \u2014 RSI can stay overbought in strong trends.\n- Earnings, guidance, and surprises\n  - Why it matters: Beats/misses and forward guidance tend to cause outsized moves in tech due to high growth expectations.\n  - What to watch: EPS/revenue beats, margin trajectory, and management commentary on demand.\n- Competitive dynamics & product cycles\n  - Why it matters: Rapid disruption or a successful new product can change market share quickly (e.g., shifts in ad platforms, cloud offerings).\n  - What to watch: Market-share data, wins/losses with major customers, product roadmaps.\n\nPractical implications \u2014 different timeframes\n- Short-term traders: Focus more on earnings, guidance, technical signals, flows and news (product launches, regulatory headlines).\n- Medium/long-term investors: Emphasize fundamentals (growth sustainability, margins, FCF), secular trends (AI/cloud), valuations vs peers, and geopolitical/regulatory risk.\n\nHow TapeScope tools can help (next steps)\n- Use the screening tool to filter tech stocks by growth, margins, P/S or FCF yield.\n- Pull fundamentals for specific tickers (revenue growth, ARR metrics, FCF) and compare to industry peers.\n- Check news flow and SEC filings for regulatory/geopolitical updates.\n- Run backtests or scenario analyses to see how a strategy behaved in rate-rising vs rate-cutting regimes.\n- Add names to a watchlist to monitor flows and earnings dates (you currently have no watchlist; add names you\u2019re tracking).\n\nIf you want live data\n- To fetch current metrics for a specific ticker, ask with the symbol (for example: \"Get AAPL fundamentals\" or \"Show NVDA P/E and revenue growth\"). I can then surface the latest available fundamentals, technicals, and news.\n\nThis is",
