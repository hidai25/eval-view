      "final_output": "Quick answer \u2014 TL;DR\nTech stocks are mainly driven by macro conditions (interest rates, growth), company fundamentals (revenue, margins, guidance), product/cycle dynamics (AI, semiconductors, cloud), capital flows & sentiment (ETF flows, momentum), and regulatory/geopolitical risks (antitrust, China). Technical factors and supply-chain constraints also matter for shorter horizons.\n\nDeeper breakdown (what each factor means and why it matters)\n- Monetary policy & interest rates\n  - Why: Discount rates affect future-growth valuations heavily. Higher rates typically compress high-growth tech multiples; easing tends to expand them.\n  - How to watch: Fed guidance, real yields, and rate-sensitivity of earnings expectations.\n\n- Economic growth and demand\n  - Why: Enterprise IT spend, consumer device purchases, and advertising budgets drive revenues. Slowing growth can dent demand; acceleration supports it.\n  - Signals: GDP, PMI, hiring data, corporate capex plans.\n\n- Company fundamentals & guidance\n  - Why: Revenue growth, gross margins, operating leverage, free cash flow, and forward guidance drive stock moves around earnings.\n  - Valuation context: Tech/growth P/E ranges commonly sit well above the market average (growth stocks: ~25\u201340; high-growth tech often 40\u2013100+), so benchmark valuations to peers and historical norms.\n\n- Product cycles & secular trends\n  - Why: New platforms (AI accelerators, cloud services, 5G devices) can re-rate leaders; hardware cycles (PC, server, smartphone) create visible revenue swings.\n  - Example themes: AI/model demand, cloud migration, edge computing, software SaaS adoption.\n\n- Supply chain & input constraints\n  - Why: Chip shortages, logistics issues, or supplier disruptions can limit production and margins for hardware and device makers.\n  - Watch: Foundry capacity, lead times, inventory levels.\n\n- Capital flows, liquidity & market structure\n  - Why: Passive/ETF flows, index rebalances, and quant/momentum strategies can amplify moves independent of fundamentals. Small-cap tech can be more flow-sensitive.\n  - Signal: AUM flows into tech ETFs, daily volume spikes.\n\n- Sentiment, newsflow & optionality risks\n  - Why: Analyst revisions, large deals, regulatory actions, or negative headlines can trigger outsized moves. Tech stocks are sentiment-sensitive.\n  - Items to monitor: Analyst revisions, insider activity (contextual), major product/launch news.\n\n- Regulatory & geopolitical risk\n  - Why: Antitrust investigations, export controls, data-privacy rules, and China/US tensions affect TAM, supply chains, and allowed business models.\n  - Impact: Can impose structural limits (e.g., market access or product restrictions) or create uncertainty that increases discount rates.\n\n- Technical factors (short- to medium-term timing)\n  - Why: Price patterns, moving averages, RSI, MACD and volume influence entry/exit timing for traders.\n  - Mandatory confirmation checklist: Always confirm technical signals with volume (is breakout backed by rising volume?), multi-timeframe checks (daily vs weekly), support/resistance retests, and momentum indicators (MACD, RSI). RSI can stay overbought in strong trends \u2014 look for confirming evidence.\n\nScenario lens (bull / base / bear interpretations)\n- Bull scenario: Strong macro growth + falling/low rates, accelerating adoption of new product cycle (e.g., AI/cloud), expanding margins \u2192 multiples expand and earnings growth justifies higher prices.\n- Base scenario: Moderate growth, stable rates, steady enterprise spending \u2192 earnings grow at trend; valuations track historical sector averages.\n- Bear scenario: Slowing demand + rising rates or regulatory shocks \u2192 revenue/margin compression and multiple contraction, especially for highest-multiple names.\n\nPractical next steps (how to use this)\n- If you want to monitor specific tickers: Tell me symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) and I can run an earnings-calendar, news-sentiment, or fundamentals summary.\n- To test a theme: Use TapeScope screening to find tech names with specific traits (high AI revenue exposure, low debt, FCF yield thresholds) or backtest a strategy on historical data.\n- For short-term trading: Combine technical confirmation checklist above with volume and multi-timeframe checks.\n- For valuation work: Compare P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF yield to industry peers and to historical ranges for the company.\n\nTools I can help you run on TapeScope\n- Earnings calendar and guidance-change heatmap\n- Thematic screens (AI, cloud, semiconductors)\n- News & sentiment streams for specific tickers\n- Valuation comparisons and peer grouping\n- Backtesting with slippage modelling\n\nIf you want real-time context for particular names, ask something like:\n- \"Show AAPL earnings calendar\"\n- \"Get NVDA news and guidance changes\"\n- \"Screen tech stocks with revenue growth >20% and FCF yield >3%\"\n\nI don\u2019t yet see any symbols in your watchlist. Tell me which companies you care about and I\u2019ll pull the relevant tools and analysis.\n\nThis is analysis, not investment advice. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
