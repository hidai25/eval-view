# Test case for Claude Agent SDK agent
# Tests weather lookup and temperature conversion

name: Claude Agent SDK Weather Test

description: |
  Test a Claude Agent SDK agent with custom tools for weather
  and temperature conversion.

input:
  query: "What's the weather in Tokyo and convert 25 celsius to fahrenheit?"

expected:
  # Expected tools to be called (handled internally by SDK)
  tools:
    - get_weather
    - convert_temperature

  output:
    contains:
      - "Tokyo"
      - "weather"
      - "77"  # 25C = 77F

thresholds:
  min_score: 75
  max_cost: 0.50
  max_latency: 30000  # 30s - SDK agents need more time
