# Failure Mode: Infinite Loop Detection
# Tests: Does the system catch agents stuck in tool loops?

name: "Infinite Loop Guard"
description: |
  The agent might get stuck calling the same tool repeatedly.
  The chaos system should:
  - Detect excessive tool calls (>10 per tool)
  - Raise LoopDetectedError
  - Agent should handle gracefully or system should terminate
