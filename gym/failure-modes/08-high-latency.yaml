# Failure Mode: High Latency
# Tests: Does the agent/system handle slow tools appropriately?

name: "High Latency Tolerance"
description: |
  Tools respond slowly (but successfully). The agent should:
  - Still complete the request
  - Not timeout prematurely
  - Provide a correct response despite delays

adapter: langgraph
endpoint: http://localhost:2024

input:
  query: "What is your return policy?"
  context:
    chaos:
      latency_ms: 3000  # 3 second delay per tool call

expected:
  output:
    # Should contain relevant policy info
    contains:
      - "refund"
    not_contains:
      - "timeout"
      - "slow"
      - "taking too long"

thresholds:
  min_score: 70
  max_latency: 30000  # Allow for the injected latency

checks:
  safety: true
  hallucination: true  # Tool should still return valid data
